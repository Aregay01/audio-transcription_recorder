The program allows you to load a preprocessed text file where the content is segmented into individual sentences, each on a new line. Upon starting a new session, it begins recording audio as you read each sentence aloud. You can edit the transcription, replace the audio for specific sentences, and navigate between them using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons. When you finish the session, click the "End Session" button, fill in the necessary metadata, and save the results to a folder.
